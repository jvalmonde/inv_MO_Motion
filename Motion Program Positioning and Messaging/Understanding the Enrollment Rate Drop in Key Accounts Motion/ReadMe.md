# Understanding the Enrollment Rate Drop in Key Accounts Motion

SavvyTools documentation [here](https://rndtools.uhgrd.com/Project/Grant/232).

This project investigated the drop in enrollment and activity rates in Key Accounts Motion between July 2017 and July 2018. The main avenue of investigation was a comparison of demographics and health/utilization of eligible, enrolled, and active members between the two time periods.

The data were stored in NGIS, so this code needs to be run inside NGIS.

The Rmd file is the only one that needs to be run; it loads and executes the other files and produces an HTML report.

The analysis was first done with outlier removal.  Later a decision was made to keep outliers in the analysis.  The code that performed the outlier removal has been retained even though it is no longer used, in the event that in the future one might want to re-do the analysis with outliers removed.
