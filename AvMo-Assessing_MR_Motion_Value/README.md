Short description:

This study updates and extends previous work from two pilots involving Medicare Advantage populations, the 2016 Walk and Win pilot and the 2017 Lifetime Value pilot.  It addresses selection effects of Motion, the stability of those selection effects, the effect of Motion on member re-enrollment, and the persistence of Motion participants in maintaining their activity levels.
