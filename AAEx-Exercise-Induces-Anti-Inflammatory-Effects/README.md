# AAEx-Exercise-Induces-Anti-Inflammatory-Effects

The goals of this initiative are: (1) Conduct a review of the scientific literature to determine how different types, intensities, and duration of physical activity reduce local and/or systemic chronic inflammation, and (2) Elucidate exercise's mechanisms of action to leverage the value of other interventions to attenuate chronic inflammation.

The designated GHGT is Kleman Roy Senyahan.
